COMP20 Fall 2017 Repository
Caroline Sheng


This repository contains all work that I have accomplished in Tufts COMP20:Web Programming
in the Fall of 2017. 


My favorite assignment during this course was Assignment 3, where we built a server for
the Black-Car Service (a mini version of Uber) in Assignment 2. What I liked most about it
was that I felt like we had finally reached a point in COMP20 where we were actually 
manipulating what goes on behind the scenes of an application. We were taking in user
input, and storing it, and retrieving it and manipulating it, all without user's
knowledge. I also liked how we were able to build off of Assignment 2, and make it even 
better, which sort of increases the satisfaction.


I think I have grown a significant amount since Day 1 of this course.  Of course, I
knew basically nothing (except a little HTML/CSS) before coming to this class, so of
course I learned the new languages that were introduced to us. I don't by any means
think that I'm an expert in any of the web programming topics we've covered, but I
think I've gotten an understanding in a breadth of things that will serve me well
in the future. 


I honestly think the most important thing I learned in this course is how to, for
lack of a better phrasing: figure things out by myself. Of course, Ming told us in
the beginning that there definitely wouldn't be hand-holding in this course. But
I think there's a sort of pride in being able to single handedly figure out how
to do something by reading code documentation and using Google.
One example of this came during Assignment 2, when we had to do the Google Maps API.
I was struggling a lot with trying to understand the logic of the assymetric calls
and how to get what I wanted out of it. Then my friend suggested I just read the
documentation of the Google Maps API. And, of course, there it was, in plain English,
a clear demonstration and explanation of how to use the API.
I was able to apply this better during the final semester project, when I was trying
to implement multiplayer for our game. It was quite challenging, but by then I was
much more comfortable in reading documentation, watching tutorials, and looking
on StackOverflow to find my answers, which made the process a lot easier.


Now that I've finished the course, I would like to learn more about web security.
Which seems like a very broad topic, but I think at the base of it I just really
like the idea behind security: which is that you have to understand how things
work underneath the hood, and I think that's a skill that'd be helpful anythere.
